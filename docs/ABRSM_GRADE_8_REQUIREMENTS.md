## Technical Notes

### Performance Requirements:
- **Evenness**: All notes should be equal in timing and volume
- **Fluency**: Smooth, confident playing without hesitation
- **Accuracy**: Correct notes, fingering, and rhythmic precision
- **Tone Quality**: Clear, consistent sound throughout
- **Tempo Consistency**: Maintain steady tempo throughout

### Common Challenges:
- **Thumb passing**: Smooth transitions when thumb passes under
- **Contrary motion coordination**: Both hands moving in opposite directions
- **Staccato evenness**: Maintaining consistent articulation
- **Speed building**: Gradual tempo increase while maintaining control
- **Starting positions**: Quick orientation to different keys

### Practice Tips:
- Practice hands separately first
- Use metronome to build speed gradually
- Focus on smooth thumb crossings
- Practice contrary motion slowly
- Work on different keys daily
- Record and listen to your playing
